# What is this?

This is some helper code that allows one to temporairly save code that they are writting in the `Firefox Multi-line Editor` to localStorage, and, if one wants to save their code more permidently, `SandStorm` allows one to upload the code they have stored in localStorage to gists if they are currently navigated to the gists page.
